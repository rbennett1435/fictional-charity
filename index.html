    <h1 class="headers">Welcome to Wild Animal Conservation Plan!</h1>
    <h3 class="headers">What do we do?</h3>
    <p class="text">
      Our goal is easily said, we wish to preserve the life of animals.
      Everyday, more and more habitats gets destroyed for resources or building.
      Our plan is to take these animals and give them a safe place to live that
      will also provide them with everything they need.

      The challenges are greater than ever, but with the focus, dedication, and
      passion of a committed staff—combined with a unique mixture of field, zoo,
      and aquarium expertise—WACP will continue to set the bar for science,
      conservation action, and education that has driven our success in
      protecting wildlife and wild places for over a century. We hold ourselves
      to the highest standards, adhering to core values of respect,
      accountability and transparency, innovation, diversity and inclusion,
      collaboration, and integrity.

    <h3 class="headers">Saving wildlife</h3>
    <p class="text">
      WACP scientists study what wildlife species need to thrive. With this
      knowledge we invest in abating threats to wildlife within their most
      important strongholds and the corridors that connect them. We target
      large, iconic, wide-ranging species because of their intrinsic value and
      because they are vital to ecosystem health. By saving them, we protect all
      other biodiversity that shelters under their conservation canopy. From
      penguins to tigers, we are trying our hardest to save endangered species'.

      WACP uses cutting-edge science to understand the impacts of climate change
      on wildlife and natural resources, plan conservation for a rapidly
      changing world, and implement on-the-ground solutions to protect
      ecosystems.

      WACPis implementing conservation programs all over the world to mitigate
      the impacts of CO2 emissions, and help affected people adapt to climate
      change. We are protecting large swaths of tropical and boreal forest that
      sequester carbon through our work to protect intact forests and a
      mechanism called REDD+. We are helping to restore degraded forest lands in
      areas of high conservation significance and where this can bring benefits
      to local people. We partner with local communities and governments to find
      science-based solutions for adapting to the immediate and projected
      impacts of climate change.
